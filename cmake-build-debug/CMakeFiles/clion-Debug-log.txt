CMake Deprecation Warning at test/lib/googletest/CMakeLists.txt:53 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning at /Users/paolomossa/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg (1)/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake:859 (_find_package):
  By not providing "FindPythonInterp.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "PythonInterp", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "PythonInterp" with
  any of the following names:

    PythonInterpConfig.cmake
    pythoninterp-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "PythonInterp" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "PythonInterp_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "PythonInterp" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
